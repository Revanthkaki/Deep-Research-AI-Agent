## **How It Works**  
The system follows a **multi-agent workflow** to process research queries:  

1. **Query Input**: The user submits a research query via the Streamlit interface or API.  
2. **Web Search**: The system performs an advanced web search using the Tavily API and extracts relevant content.  
3. **Content Analysis**: The research agent summarizes the extracted content and identifies key insights.  
4. **Fact Verification**: The verification agent validates claims and assesses source credibility.  
5. **Draft Generation**: The draft agent creates a structured response based on the research findings.  
6. **Final Review**: The controller agent reviews and refines the draft into a polished final response.  
7. **Output**: The system returns the final response, along with sources and evaluation metrics.
